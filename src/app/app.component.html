    This is an app built with tensorflow and opencv to remove the background from a video feed and place a crown on the
    user's head.
  </p>
  <p>
    It runs completely in the browser and uses the javascript implementation of tensorflow and opencv.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please be patient as it may take a while to load.
  </p>
  <p>
    It should turn on the default camera, or the selfie camera. Once you have given permission to use the camera.
  </p>
  <p>
    The app was built in a single day, and is not fine tuned.
